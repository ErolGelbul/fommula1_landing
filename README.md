## 3. Disclaimer and Purpose

Fommula1 is a front-end mockup application designed to simulate the appearance
and functionality of a real-time data analysis platform for Formula 1 racing. It
is essential to note that Fommula1 does not use any proprietary or confidential
information obtained directly from Formula 1 or its associated entities, nor
does it utilize actual data for analysis.

As a front-end demonstration, Fommula1 employs static, placeholder data and
presents a user interface that mimics a genuine app. The purpose of Fommula1 is
to showcase design and development skills, highlighting the potential for
creating a data-driven decision-making tool in the world of Formula 1 racing.

Please be aware that Fommula1 is a conceptual project and not a fully functional
platform for real-world application.
